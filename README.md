# Fake-news-Detection
To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.
I build a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset. Then, I initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well the model fares. We got an accuracy of 92.82% with this model.
